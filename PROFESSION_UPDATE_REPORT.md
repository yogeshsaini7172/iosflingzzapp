  - Checks if user's profession matches partner's preferred professions
  - Bidirectional matching (both ways)
  - Gives default score if no profession preference specified
  - **Scoring breakdown:**

#### `partner_preferences` table:
- `preferred_professions` (text[]) - Array of preferred profession strings

**Migration SQL:**
```sql
-- Add preferred_professions to partner_preferences if not exists
ALTER TABLE partner_preferences 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS preferred_professions text[] DEFAULT '{}';

-- Ensure profession column exists in profiles
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profession text DEFAULT 'Student';
```
