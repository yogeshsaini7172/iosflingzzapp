ðŸŽ¯ SIMPLIFIED LOCATION PERMISSION SYSTEM
==========================================

âœ… COMPLETED CHANGES:

1. **Removed Custom UI Popup**
   - Eliminated LocationPermissionPopup component usage
   - Removed manual location input form
   - Removed custom permission dialog

2. **Direct Browser Permission**
   - Location permission now uses browser's native dialog
   - When autoFetch=true, immediately triggers location request
   - User sees standard browser permission prompt

3. **Simplified Flow**
   - Component mounts â†’ Immediately requests location permission
   - Browser shows native "Allow this site to access your location?" dialog
   - User clicks "Allow" or "Block" directly in browser
   - No custom UI interference

4. **Clean Error Handling**
   - If permission denied: Simply logs error, no popup
   - If location disabled: Component shows status only
   - No fallback to IP location automatically

ðŸ“± USER EXPERIENCE:

1. User opens profile/app
2. Browser immediately shows: "grad-sync wants to know your location"
3. User clicks "Allow" â†’ Location detected and saved
4. User clicks "Block" â†’ Shows location unavailable message

ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

- useLocation hook: autoFetch triggers immediate permission request
- getCurrentLocation: No IP fallback, forces native permission
- LocationPermission: Clean read-only display only
- All components use autoFetch=true for automatic behavior

âœ¨ RESULT: Clean, native browser location permission experience!
